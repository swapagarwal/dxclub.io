        This idea was born in one of our monthly meetups. Folks had written drafts on some of the topics but were scared to put them out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        On probing further, it was the case that they didn’t want to publicly associate the post with their names in case it doesn’t get good reception. This traps them in a vicious cycle: They don’t publish because they feel the writing is not good enough, and the writing can’t improve without feedback!
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, we are announcing “The Next Big Writer” experiment:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Write your post in markdown and <a href="https://github.com/swapagarwal/dxclub.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit a PR</a> under drafts folder.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will be published to Hashnode under a pseudonym.
          </li>
          <li>
            It’ll be shared on Twitter and our Telegram group.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        The aim is to get you reach so that you get feedback (likes / comments), which is the only way to improve. Spread the word!
