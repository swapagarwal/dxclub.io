        This idea was born in one of our monthly meetups (Feb 9, 2020). Folks had written drafts on some of the topics but were scared to put them out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        On probing further, it was the case that they didn‚Äôt want to publicly associate the post with their names in case it doesn‚Äôt get good reception. This traps them in a vicious cycle: They don‚Äôt publish because they feel the writing is not good enough, and the writing can‚Äôt improve without feedback!
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, we are announcing ‚ÄúThe Next Big Writer‚Äù program:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Write your post in markdown and <a href="https://github.com/iamshadmirza/TheNextBigWriter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit a draft</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have a team of awesome mentors that will provide you constructive (and critical) feedback on your writing style and content.
          </li>
          <li>
            After you make the required edits, it will be published to Hashnode in the publication "<a href="https://thenextbigwriter.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheNextBigWriter</a>".
          </li>
          <li>
            Our mentors will help you in gaining confidence so that you can proudly associate your article with your name.
          </li>
        </ol>
