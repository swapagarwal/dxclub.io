  <h2>Screw The Taboos Meetup</h2>
  <pre>
    Let's talk about taboos in tech!

    This meetup aims to provide a safe space for developers,
    where we talk openly about things like
    the discrepancy between job descriptions and day-to-day work,
    coping with burnout,
    dealing with jerks at the workplace, etc.
    Other open topics include, but are not limited to, imposter syndrome, mental health, growth, etc.

    There are no talks - everyone shall be involved in a round-table discussion.
    P.S. It's open to everyone regardless of the technology you're using.
    P.P.S. Chatham House Rules apply.

    The first-ever edition of #ScrewTheTaboos takes place on December 15, 2019.
    When? 11am - 1pm
    Where? The Terrace @ Hasura
